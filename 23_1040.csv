If you find a data entry cell to be protected, it is because it is a calculated value using 
input from another location in the spreadsheet.  Read the instructions for that line to determine where 
the values are derived.  However, for most calculated cells, a manual override cell is provided if you 
need to override the calculated value.  After a while, you will figure out that the spreadsheet is completely functional without needing to unprotect it.","","","","","","","","","","","",""
